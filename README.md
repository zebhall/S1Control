S1Control is remote-control software for Bruker pXRF Instruments - works with the S1 TITAN, TRACER 5i/5g, CTX, and XMS.
Built as a service tool primarily, and as a programming excercise, so U.A.Y.O.R.
Prepackaged portable windows executable can be found in /dist/.
Tested and working on Windows (7,10,11), and Linux (Ubuntu 23.10, Fedora Workstation 38).
Install all of the .ttf font files found in the root directory to ensure UI text consistency.
