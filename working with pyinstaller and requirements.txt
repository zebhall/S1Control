to reduce bloated exe file sizes:

1. before anything else, take a backup of all installed python modules. open cmd then
	pip freeze > oldrequirements.txt		
   this will create requirements.txt so you can reinstall all modules later.

2. uninstall all modules
	pip uninstall -r oldrequirements.txt -y

3. reinstall pyinstaller
	pip install pyinstaller

4. try running .py file, see what requirements are needed, and install using pip

5. once py file can run again, save copy of requirements for this program.
	pip freeze > oldrequirements.txt

6. build exe using pyinstaller as usual.

7. afterwards, can install all old modules again if needed
	pip install -r oldrequirements.txt






(note: pywin32 might need to be installed manually before xerox and some others)
	pip install --upgrade pywin32
